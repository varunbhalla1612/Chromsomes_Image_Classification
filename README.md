Chromosome Analysis or Karyotyping is done to find  
1. Abnormalities such as birth defects/genetic diseases etc.
2. Structural Inconsistencies 

Laboratory process:
1. Take Sample of Your Cells 
2. Sample placed in a laboratory dish that allows the cells to grow.
3. Stain the cells.
4. Observe Under a Microscope (Metaphase)

* Chromosomal suspension is dropped onto slides and stained which results in a kind of banding pattern (what we get is called a metaphase spread)

You should get 46 chromosomes.
Two of these chromosomes are sex chromosomes (determine the sex of the person being tested). Females - XX, Males - XY
The other 44 are called autosomes.
